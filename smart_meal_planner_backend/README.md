### Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **black**: Code formatting
- **pylint**: Code linting
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **bandit**: Security scanning
- **safety**: Dependency security checking

Run code quality checks locally:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Run linting
pylint **/*.py

# Run type checking
mypy .

# Run security checks
bandit -r .
safety check
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline:

1. Runs on every push and pull request to main branch
2. Tests against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
3. Performs:
   - Code formatting check (black)
   - Linting (pylint)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Unit tests (pytest)
   - Coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
   - Security scanning (bandit, safety)
4. Uploads coverage reports to Codecov

### Environment Variables for CI/CD

Required secrets in GitHub:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for tests
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key for tests

### Pre-commit Hooks

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will run code quality checks before each commit.
